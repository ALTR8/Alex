### Quick Bundling

Caroline made a custom gulp task that reads components from a `.json` file and simply appends them together. This helps to encapsulate things in to individual components.

Feel free to replace the quick bundling (see `/tasks/quick-bundle.js` to see what it does) with whatever method you want (simple JS files, browserify, RequireJS, etc).
